/**
 * The default ticket registry cleaner scans the entire CAS ticket registry
 * for expired tickets and removes them.  This process is only required so that
 * the size of the ticket registry will not grow beyond a reasonable size.
 * The functionality of CAS is not dependent on a ticket being removed as soon
 * as it is expired.
 * <p><strong>NEW</strong> in 3.3.6:</p>
 * <p>
 * Locking strategies may be used to support high availability environments.
 * In a clustered CAS environment with several CAS nodes executing ticket
 * cleanup, it is desirable to execute cleanup from only one CAS node at a time.
 * This dramatically reduces the potential for deadlocks in
 * JPA-backed ticket registries, for example.
 *
 * By default this implementation uses {@link NoOpLockingStrategy} to preserve
 * the same semantics as previous versions, but specific locking strategies
 * for JPA should be used with a JPA-backed ticket registry
 * in a clustered CAS environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>The following property is required.</p>
